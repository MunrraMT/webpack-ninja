### Descrição do curso:

Webpack 5 Ninja - Build Nodejs and Web apps complete guide

Webpack is one of the most essential tools for all web applications. This is going to be a very hands-on course, we are going to cover the basics concepts to some of the advanced concepts of Webpack 5 and see how we can use this tool to optimize a web application.

We are not only going to go over the concepts, but also take a real website I have created for this course and apply all our understanding to this course website. We shall apply core concepts such as Loaders to load CSS / Images and more, and Plugins to automate lots of stuff, then we shall see how we can tweak configurations specific to both the development and production environment.

I have also included a bonus section wherein we will create a React application from scratch without the use of the "create react app" utility. This will give a solid understanding of all the concepts and what happens behind the scene.


I have tried my best to structure this course in the easiest way to follow and will have all the resources available to download on Github as well as attached to this course.

You can always ask me questions in the Q&A sections in case you face problems, I shall be happy to answer.

This course does not require any knowledge of Webpack and will be beneficial to all developers making any type of website whether it's using core HTML CSS or using frameworks and libraries such as React and Angular.


Good luck and happy learning!
